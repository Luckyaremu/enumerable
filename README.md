> Rspec Enumerable-Methods

## What does it do

This project contains an implementation of some of the Ruby's enumerable methods

This is a project that adds new methods onto the existing Enumerable module of Ruby
I added the following methods which are my own version of the originals.
-my_each my_each_with_index -my_select -my_all? -my_any? -my_none? -my_count -my_map -my_inject
